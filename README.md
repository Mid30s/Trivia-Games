## Concept

This is an application for the individual who has limited spare time but is still interested in improving their knowledge. Whether they have five minutes on public transport, waiting for a meeting to start, the kids are entertaining themselves for once, or they have finally hit the couch after a long day-this is an application to casually improve your knowledge in short time sessions.

## Description
 The user is able to choose from a variety of categories to randomly generate a ten question test. If the user is unsure of the answer they have the option of using the "hint" button. This generates the top three Wikipedia searches related to the question. The user is then able to click any of the links to search for the answer on Wikipedia. There is also a specific search bar where the user can delve deeper into the wealth of knowledge provided by Wikipedia. The user can then check each individual answer. If correct the text entry box will turn green, if incorrect the text entry box will turn red and the correct answer will be given. The user then still has the option to use the specific search bar to learn more about the correct answer. Once the user has answered every question they can submit their test to recieve thier score. Every correct answer they get will accumulate and the user will move up a level every ten correct questions. The levels will be displayed by a gold coin for each level the user has surpassed.
